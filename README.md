# The Odin Project - Ruby on Rails - Sample Application
## Rails 4 WebApplication - Twitter Clone 

This is the `README.md` for my Odin Project rebuild of the Rails Tutorial .

### Why did i want to rebuild it a forth time?

I've built the Rails Tutorial 3 times now, and i've also built 10 other applications using the Rails Tutorial as a base to work from. I would start a new application with a copy/paste of the code from 10, my app would replace chapter 11 and i'd use chapter 12 if i needed it. The problem with that approach is i never started from scratch enough, and i know i should have gained more knowledge because i still have gaps in my knowledge that i shouldn't have. So, figured i'd start over with the Odin Project.
